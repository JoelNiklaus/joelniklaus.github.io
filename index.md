on NLP. Prior to his current roles, Joel was an AI Resident at (Google) X, where he trained multi-billion parameter LLMs
on hundreds of TPUs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on LegalBench. His experience also includes investigating
efficient domain-specific pretraining approaches at Thomson Reuters Labs.

Joel's academic journey led him to Stanford University, where he conducted research on LLMs in the legal domain under
the supervision of Prof. Dan Ho and Prof. Percy Liang. He has served as an advisor to companies specializing in the
applications of modern NLP to legal challenges and has led research projects for the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. With

I'm currently operating at near capacity with my existing commitments, but I am still open to consulting/advising on
exceptional projects that pique my interest.
