Knowledge Graph Construction from Swiss Big Data
------------------------------------------------

This project is available as a Seminar or Bachelor's project.

### Introduction

Swiss court decisions are anonymized to protect the privacy of the involved people (parties, victims, etc.). Previous research \[1\] has shown that it is possible to re-identify companies involved in court decisions by linking the rulings with external data in certain cases. Our project tries to further build an automated system for re-identifying involved people from court rulings. This system can then be used as a test for the anonymization practice of Swiss courts. For more information regarding the overarching research project, please [go here](https://www.digitale-nachhaltigkeit.unibe.ch/index_eng.html).

We propose to approach the general problem of re-identification (not only for a specific domain) with knowledge graphs (ontologies). In this project, you will construct knowledge graphs from both Swiss newspaper articles and court decisions.

### Research Questions

So far, to the best of our knowledge, no one has built a knowledge graph from Swiss newspaper articles or court decisions.

RQ1: How can we build a knowledge graph from large text files?

### Steps

1.  Construct a knowledge graph from newspaper articles (data is already available)
2.  Construct a knowledge graph from court decisions (data is already available)
3.  Analyze the quality of the knowledge graph
