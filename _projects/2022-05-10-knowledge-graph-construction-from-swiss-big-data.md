title: "Knowledge Graph Construction from Swiss Big Data"
---

### Introduction

We propose to approach the general problem of re-identification (not only for a specific domain) with knowledge graphs (ontologies). In this project, you will construct knowledge graphs from both Swiss newspaper articles and court decisions.

### Research Questions

So far, to the best of our knowledge, no one has built a knowledge graph from Swiss newspaper articles or court decisions.

RQ1: How can we build a knowledge graph from large text files?

### Steps

1.  Construct a knowledge graph from newspaper articles (data is already available)
2.  Construct a knowledge graph from court decisions (data is already available)
3.  Analyze the quality of the knowledge graph
