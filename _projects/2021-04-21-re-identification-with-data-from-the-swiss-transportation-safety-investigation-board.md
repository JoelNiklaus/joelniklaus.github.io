### Introduction

There are court decisions tackling all kinds of accidents, such as accidents involving trains, cars, and airplanes. Such accidents are also described on the website of Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSB). The aim of this project is to find out, to what extent this information can be used to re-identify entities occurring in court decisions.
