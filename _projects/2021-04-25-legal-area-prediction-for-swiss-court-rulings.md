### Introduction

Big Courts like the Swiss Federal Supreme Court have many different departments and chambers each responsible for different legal areas. Therefore, an automatic system, which can route a new complaint directly to the responsible department would be very handy for these courts and free up secretaries' time for more important work. Since we do not have access to the complaints we take the facts of a case as a proxy and coin the task Legal Area Prediction, which predicts the legal area from the facts of a case.
