### Introduction

In our previous works, we developed a command-line based pipeline in Java to identify various information types from class comments \[1\]. The pipeline preprocesses the comments stored in database, process them, and prepares a machine-learning based classification model.  In another follow-up work \[2\], we developed a JavaScript-based web browser plugin that identifies the comments from a file in a GitHub repository and classify it into various categories or information types.

The aim of this project is to improve the pipeline in classifying the comments and make a working prototype tool to help developers get an overview of what their comments contain.
