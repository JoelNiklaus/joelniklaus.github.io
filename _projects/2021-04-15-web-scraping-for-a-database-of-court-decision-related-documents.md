### Introduction

For a successful re-identification of involved people in a court decision, we need external data. This project has the goal of building a well-structured database of external data connected to Swiss federal court rulings.

List of possible data sources:

*   Media messages of the courts (e.g. the [federal court](https://www.bger.ch/index/press/press-inherit-template/press-mitteilungen.htm?histo=true))
*   [BAG Bulletin](ttps://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/das-bag/publikationen/periodika/bag-bulletin.html)
*   [Swiss Transporation Safety Investigation Board](https://www.sust.admin.ch/en/stsb-homepage/)
*   Newspapers (SRF, swissdox, etc.)
*   Online phone books (e.g. local.ch)
*   Social Media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook)
*   Government documents
*   Trade registers/Business register (e.g. Moneyhouse)
*   Map Information systems/Land register
